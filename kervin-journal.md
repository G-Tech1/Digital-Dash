- Together as a team we did research on if it is possible to access client-side network performance data from our frontend. After doing research we found out that for security reasons we won't be able to access system settings from our frontend. We discussed what this would mean for our mvp

 - I came up with the idea to build cli tools for each performance setting we want to analiyze and make the tools available for users with an account on our website. This idea is dependent on whether or not we would be able to send info collected in our cli tool back to our main website. I built a speed test using stack overflow and youtube tutorials however it did not perform How I wanted it to so I am going to refine it for accuracy. Together as a group we built an extremely simple cli tool and made a successful post request to our main website thus proving that our idea would be able to be implemented.

 - I added bootstrap to our react frontend and made design changes. I also redesigned our frontend speed test for better accuracy.
